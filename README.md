# Linear Regression and Classification with Iris Dataset

This repository contains Python functions and scripts for performing linear regression and classification on the Iris dataset. The script includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using both sigmoid and tanh activation functions.

## Description

The project demonstrates the use of linear regression for classification tasks. It includes functions to calculate the mean squared error (MSSE), fit a linear model, and classify data points based on the fitted model. The Iris dataset is used to showcase these techniques.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Reads and preprocesses the Iris dataset.
  - Encodes categorical labels.
  - Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- **Linear Regression**:
  - Calculates the weight vector \( W \) using MSSE.
- **Classification**:
  - Classifies data points using sigmoid and tanh activation functions.
  - Evaluates the accuracy of the classification.

## Usage

To use these functions, clone this repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Linear-Regression-Classification-Iris.git
